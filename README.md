# Voronoi Diagrams

This project was done as an assignment for CPSC 221 at the University of British Columbia. It simulates the pointillistic effect using a mathematical construct called a Voronoi Diagram, based on points randomly selected from the given photograph.

Following is the sample output. I drew the maple leaf using both Breath First Search and Depth First Search:
